# **About Me**

Hi I'm **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br><br>
I make games, and also game development tutorials! I publish a video every week on my [channel](https://www.youtube.com/nedmakesgames) on topics ranging from: toon shaders, grass, outlines, camera controllers, and more. I focus on supporting small, indie developers and covering the Unity game engine and it's Universal Rendering Pipeline. I maintain a searchable list of tutorials in my *Tutorials & Posts* page!<br><br>
My viewers help support my channel with my [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/nedmakesgames)! There, I give them special perks, including early tutorial access, downloadable project files, and voting power on topic polls. *Thank you for your support!*<br><br>
I have over 15 years of game development experience, much of that with Unity! I've also worked with XNA and Unreal. In terms of programming languages, I am "fluent" in C#, HLSL, Java, Lua, and Ruby, and somewhat in C++. I have extensive experience with visual programming, such as Unity's Shader Graph and Unreal's Blueprints. I know my way around DaVinci Resolve, Blender, Inkscape, Aseprite, OBS, and Audacity.<br><br>
I'm a proficent game jammer! I've made over 25 short games, usually over the period of a month. Check them out on my *Projects* page.<br><br>
I live in the USA with my dog and three cats. Yes, you read that right! When I have free time, I enjoy playing games, DMing table top RPGs, worldbuilding, weight lifting, and making low-spec art.<br><br>
Thanks again for visiting!
