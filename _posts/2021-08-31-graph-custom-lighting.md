Do you have a material that doesn't look quite right in Unity's URP lit shader graph? Or would you like to experiment with stylized art styles with the convenience of the shader graph? In this tutorial, I show how to implement custom lighting, allowing you to solve both those problems. Afterwards, you could extend the graphs I show here to make a toon shader or handle difficult materials, like plant foliage, hair, skin, or fabric.
