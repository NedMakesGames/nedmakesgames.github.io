Grass is one of those things most games need, but is really difficult to get right! In this video, I return to grass to try to conquer it! I lay the groundwork here, using a compute shader to generate blades of grass in a mesh, while randomizing and animating it in a graphics shader. I also try out level of detail to speed up rendering.
