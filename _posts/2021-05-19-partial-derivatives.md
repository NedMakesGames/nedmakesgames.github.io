To continue investigating mipmaps, I want to introduce the partial derivative shader functions in Unity URP! These functions, DDX, DDY, and FWidth, seem magical! You can pass any variable to them, and they'll give you the amount it changes over one screen pixel. Let's see how they work, how they relate to mipmaps, and how to use them for interesting effects!
