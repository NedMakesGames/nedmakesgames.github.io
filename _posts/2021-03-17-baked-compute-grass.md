Grass is one of those things most games need, but is really difficult to get right! In this series of videos, I investigate generating the grass mesh once, or baking it, using a compute shader at edit time. Then, I rely on the graphics shader to animate it. I also experiment with level of detail and prepare to add terrain and interaction support. There are two types of grass meshes I demonstrate how to make: blade and layered grass.
