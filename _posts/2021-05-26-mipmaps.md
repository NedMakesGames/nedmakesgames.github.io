Mipmaps are scaled down versions of textures Unity generates and draws when a texture takes up a small area on the screen. This saves memory and looks better to boot! In this video, I go over Unity's mipmap generation settings and show how to create custom mipmaps. I also quickly demonstrate a cool trick Nintendo used to make Mario Sunshine's water!

In the second video, I wrap up this series on mipmaps by investigating how the renderer chooses which mip level to use and how you can influence this with SampleTexture2DLOD and mipmap biases. I also show how to sample textures outside of the fragment shader stage.
