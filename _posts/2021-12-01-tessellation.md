Tessellation shaders are advanced shaders which can subdivide triangles in a mesh, creating new vertices. You can move these around for a variety of cool effects! This tutorial aims to give you a deep understanding of tessellation shaders in Unity by first explaining how to write your own and then showcasing several algorithms which use them. Some effects include advance culling, dynamic level of detail, curved triangles, smoothed silhouettes, height map rendering, and procedural meshes.
