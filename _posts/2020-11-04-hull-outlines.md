Outlines are a fun technique to add style to your game and pair perfectly with toon shaders. There are a variety of ways to implement them, and in this video, I look at one of them. I use a renderer feature to render a mesh twice, extruding the "hull" to create an outline. In the process, I write a script to handle sharp corners.
