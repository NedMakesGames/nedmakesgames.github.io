Would you like to start writing shaders but donâ€™t know where to start? Or, have you encountered a limitation of URPâ€™s Shader Graph you need to overcome? In this tutorial series, Iâ€™ll walk you through writing a fully featured, general purpose shader for Unityâ€™s Universal Render Pipeline â€” exclusively in code. Don't know HLSL or ShaderLab? No problem.
