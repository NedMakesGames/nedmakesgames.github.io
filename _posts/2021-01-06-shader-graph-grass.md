Grass rendering is a challenging problem in many games. One way to solve it is to use billboard or cross meshes - a good idea for lightweight platforms. In this series, I explain how to animate such a mesh in Unity Universal Render Pipeline's shader graph and place grass prefabs in a pattern to naturally form a field. Then, I show how to use a renderer feature to add interactive trampling effects.
