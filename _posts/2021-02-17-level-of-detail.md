Level of detail, or LOD, is a technique where the system chooses different versions of a mesh to render based on how much screen space it takes up. If a mesh only takes up a small dot on the screen, no reason to render hundreds of triangles! In this video, I show how to set up LOD in Unity using LODGroup components, adjust LOD quality settings, import LOD-ready models from Blender, script a dithered crossfade shader for URP, and receive C# messages when an LOD level changes.
