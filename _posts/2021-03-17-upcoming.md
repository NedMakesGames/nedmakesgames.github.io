Here's an *incomplete* list of topics I am planning to cover, not in any particular order. They may not go live for some time.

- Blade grass on mesh-based and Unity's heightmap-based terrain.
- Advanced interactive trample effects for blade grass using a second camera and a trample texture.
- A "2D Puzzle Dungeon," or Zelda-like, game prototype.
- Introduction to code shaders through recreating the Universal Render Pipeline's basic lit shader.
- More compute shaders.
- More procedural materials.
- Marching squares and marching cubes.
- More outline techniques, including jump flood outlines and vertex color outlines.
- Water!
