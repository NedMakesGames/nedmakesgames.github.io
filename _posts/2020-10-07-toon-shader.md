Toon Shaders, also called Cel Shaders, create a cartoon-like style with segmented shading. In these videos, I'll show you how to create toon shaders in Unity using Shader Graph. Features include: diffuse and specular lighting, color textures, shading ramp textures, shadows, and multiple light sources. The custom lighting techniques can be used in a variety of shaders down the line!
