Grass is a tough thing to render in games! In this series, I investgate rendering grass using a compute shader to build meshes dynamically at runtime, incorporating level of detail into the mesh itself.

Although there is a lot to be learned from this series, this grass is not optimized, and I recommend you use [baked grass mesh renderers](baked-compute-grass) instead.
