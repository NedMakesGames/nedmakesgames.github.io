Triangle winding direction is a pillar of Unity's rendering system. Triangle points are ordered, and the way they're positioned on the screen, either clockwise or counter-clockwise, determines whether Unity will render them or not. You can change this behaviour my modifying the culling mode with a double-sided material. In this video, I explain how to do so with the default URP lit shaders, a custom code shader, and a URP shader graph.
