Noise, in graphics programming, is a function that produces pseudorandom numbers based purely on its input. Usually, it follows some pattern, but white noise has no pattern! This makes it perfect to generate random offsets, normals, or colors for a variety of shader effects. It's also useful in procedural generation, to make sure the world persists over playthroughs. In this video, I explain how white noise works and show some of its practical uses.
