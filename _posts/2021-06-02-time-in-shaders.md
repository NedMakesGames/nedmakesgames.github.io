Getting the current time in shaders is easier that it seems at first! Unity provides a shader graph node and many HLSL variables for your every need, but what exactly do they contain? When does the time counter begin? Is it affected by time scaling? I look into the URP source to find out. Time allows you to animate in shaders, which is super powerful! I showcase two animating shaders: one which loops, and one which starts at a specified time.
