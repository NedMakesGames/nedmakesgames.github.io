Geometry shaders are special shaders that can add, remove, and modify mesh triangles from the GPU, allowing you to create deformation effects and procedurally constructed models. You can use them for grass, fur, wireframes, particles and more. These shaders, unfortunately, cannot be written in a shader graph, so I'll walk you through writing one in code!
