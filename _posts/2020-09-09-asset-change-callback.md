If you need to build a database for your game data, it's super helpful to know OnPostprocessAllAssets. I'll show you how to use it! Unity calls this function when it detects changes to asset files, allowing you to automatically compile a runtime database, synchronize files, build asset bundles, or anything else you might need.
