Mipmaps are scaled down versions of textures Unity generates and draws when a texture takes up a small area on the screen. This saves memory and looks better to boot! In this video, I go over Unity's mipmap generation settings and show how to create custom mipmaps. I also quickly demonstrate a cool trick Nintendo used to make Mario Sunshine's water!
