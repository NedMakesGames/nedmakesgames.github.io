In this video, I show how to create a sand dune material using Unity Universal Render Pipeline (URP) Shader Graph! There's no textures required - instead I use various functions to construct the needed shapes. The finished graph includes color, shines, and a normal map. In fact, I go over a way to create a smooth normal map from a generated height map.
