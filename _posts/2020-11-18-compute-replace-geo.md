Compute Shaders are scripts that run on the GPU! They're very powerful, allowing you to leverage the GPU's unique abilities and generate meshes to draw procedurally. There's not a lot of information on using them, so I hope to demystify them and add another wrench to your game development toolbox. Specifically, I convert a geometry shader to a compute shader, increasing compatibility and efficiency.
