Renderer features are custom render passes you can add to your game using Unity's Universal Render Pipeline. You can use them to create your own post-processing or special effects! In this video, I create a versatile feature which can render any material and demonstrate how to manipulate features with scripts during runtime. As an example, I make a desaturation effect.
